# Introduction

    * The aim of this small project is to make a static page that creates random sayings for the user after they interact with the page through clicking a button that triggers a event that changes the text in a textfield and generate a random saying about life for the user.

## The technologies used

    * HTML5
    * CSS3
    * Javascript
    * NodeJs

## Tools used

    * Visual studio code interactive development environment was used for this mini project to develop my project on my local machine.
    * I had Node.js installed locally to run my Javascript code.
    * I used ChromeDeveloper tools in the browser to make changes to my code and see the output of those changes to help speed up development.
    * I used git bash commandline set up my version control so that I could save my changes to my portfolio on github and have a copy saved to the cloud for other developers to collaborate more easily.

### User experience design

    * Users of my webpage need a simple button that is interactive, a nice layout and color sceme and font that will fit nicely and display well on all devices. 
    * The user should be presented with a relaxing page that allows them to get a thought provoking saying and help them reflect on it. 

### UX and defensive programming

    * Being a simple webpage that generates a simple saying the load times should be fast and to make maintenance easier, comments and separations of code into seperate files was used. It would also help with making the speed of the page faster.
    * The layout was built with modern HTML5 elements to structure the content to be satisfactory for the user to help evoke a positive feeling through good balanced layout.
    * I used well known fonts that have good cross browser compatability.

### Resources used

    * I referenced my codecademy notes.
    * Mozilla developer network resources.
    * W3Schools
